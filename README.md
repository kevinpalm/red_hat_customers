# Introduction

This project contains code and a report pertaining to my work on the
August 1st - November 1st, 2016 Red Hat Kaggle Competition. In addition
to a submitted entry to the competition, I also hope to use my work here
as my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree capstone project. I've chosen
this specific project because it relates a lot to my current job, in
which I work as part of a business development department. For a
specific introduction to the competition and its goals, and to my
project, see the report file.

# Set Up

In order to run this repository, [you'll need to download the competition data files](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value/data),
and so you'll probably need to agree to the competition rules/terms.
Store the data files in a directory named "data" inside the repository
root directory, and you'll be all set up.
